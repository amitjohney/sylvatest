# ClusterAPI Integration with Sylva

## Overview

ClusterAPI is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters. Sylva leverages ClusterAPI to streamline the management of Kubernetes clusters that it runs on. This document outlines how ClusterAPI is integrated with Sylva and provides guidance on how to use it within the Sylva ecosystem.
