# Pivoting to the Management Cluster with ClusterAPI

## Overview

Pivoting is a critical operation within the ClusterAPI workflow, where the management of Kubernetes clusters transitions from a temporary bootstrap cluster to the target management cluster. This document will explain the concept of pivoting in the context of ClusterAPI and provide a framework for understanding how it applies to Sylva.

## Understanding Pivoting

Pivoting is a process specific to ClusterAPI that involves moving the cluster management from a local or temporary bootstrap cluster to a long-lived management cluster.

### The Role of the Bootstrap Cluster

TODO: Describe the role and purpose of the bootstrap cluster in the ClusterAPI ecosystem.

### The Target Management Cluster

TODO: Explain what the management cluster is and why it's important for the long-term operation of Sylva-managed Kubernetes clusters.

## Pre-Pivot Considerations

Before initiating the pivot process, certain preparatory steps must be taken to ensure a smooth transition.

### Ensuring ClusterAPI Components are Ready

TODO: List the checks and preparations needed before pivoting, such as verifying ClusterAPI components and CRDs on the bootstrap cluster.

## Pivoting Process

The process of pivoting involves several steps that must be carefully executed to ensure the management cluster takes over without issues.

### Step-by-Step Pivoting Guide

TODO: Provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to pivoting from the bootstrap cluster to the management cluster within the Sylva ecosystem.

## Post-Pivot Verification

After pivoting, it's crucial to verify that the management cluster is functioning correctly and is ready to manage workload clusters.

### Verifying Cluster Resources

TODO: Outline the steps for verifying that all cluster resources have been successfully transferred to the management cluster.

## Sylva-Specific Pivoting Considerations

Sylva may introduce specific considerations or steps in the pivoting process that are unique to its architecture.

### Custom Resources and Configurations

TODO: Detail any Sylva-specific resources or configurations that need to be accounted for during the pivoting process.

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues during the pivoting process is not uncommon. This section will provide guidance on how to troubleshoot common problems.

### Common Pivoting Issues and Solutions

TODO: Discuss common issues that may arise during pivoting and provide potential solutions or workarounds.

## FAQ

TODO: Compile a list of frequently asked questions related to pivoting and the management cluster in the context of Sylva and ClusterAPI.

This document serves as a foundation for understanding the pivotal role of pivoting in ClusterAPI and its significance within the Sylva framework. The TODO sections are placeholders for Sylva-specific information and guidance that will be added to complete the documentation.
