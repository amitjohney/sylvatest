# Understanding the Bootstrap Cluster Concept with ClusterAPI

## Overview

The bootstrap cluster is a temporary Kubernetes cluster used to initialize a more permanent management cluster. This document will explain the role of the bootstrap cluster within the ClusterAPI framework and how it relates to the Sylva ecosystem.

## The Role of a Bootstrap Cluster

The bootstrap cluster serves as a temporary staging area for the ClusterAPI resources needed to create the management cluster.

### Purpose and Lifecycle

TODO: Describe the purpose of the bootstrap cluster, its lifecycle, and how it fits into the ClusterAPI process.

## Creating a Bootstrap Cluster with ClusterAPI

ClusterAPI uses the bootstrap cluster to provision and manage the lifecycle of the management cluster.

### Prerequisites and Setup

TODO: List the prerequisites and the steps required to set up a bootstrap cluster within the Sylva ecosystem.

## Transitioning from Bootstrap to Management Cluster

The transition from the bootstrap cluster to the management cluster is a critical phase in the ClusterAPI workflow.

### Pivoting to the Management Cluster

TODO: Explain the process of pivoting from the bootstrap cluster to the management cluster and how it is handled in Sylva.

## Sylva-Specific Bootstrap Considerations

When using Sylva, there may be specific considerations to take into account during the bootstrap phase.

### Custom Configurations and Resources

TODO: Detail any Sylva-specific configurations or resources that are important during the bootstrap phase.

## Cleaning Up the Bootstrap Cluster

Once the management cluster is operational, the bootstrap cluster can be decommissioned.

### Decommissioning Steps

TODO: Provide a guide for safely decommissioning the bootstrap cluster after the management cluster is successfully deployed.

## Troubleshooting

Issues may arise during the bootstrap phase that require troubleshooting.

### Common Bootstrap Issues and Solutions

TODO: Discuss common issues that may occur during the bootstrap phase and offer solutions or workarounds.

## FAQ

TODO: Compile a list of frequently asked questions related to the bootstrap cluster in the context of Sylva and ClusterAPI.

This document aims to provide a clear understanding of the bootstrap cluster concept and its importance in the ClusterAPI and Sylva frameworks. The TODO sections are placeholders for detailed, Sylva-specific information that will be added to complete the documentation.
