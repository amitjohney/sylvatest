# Installation Guidelines Using kubeadm

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using `kubeadm` to install a Kubernetes cluster. `kubeadm` is a tool built to provide `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` for creating Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A compatible host system (or systems) to serve as the node(s) for your Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl` installed on all nodes.
- A compatible container runtime installed on all nodes.
- Network connectivity between all nodes in the cluster.

TODO: Add any Sylva-specific prerequisites that may be necessary.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to use `kubeadm` for installing your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Initialize the Control Plane Node**: On the first node, which will serve as the control plane, run the `kubeadm init` command.

    ```shell
    kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=<network-cidr>
    ```

    Replace `<network-cidr>` with the network CIDR for the pod network. This will vary depending on the network plugin you choose.

    TODO: Provide the exact `kubeadm init` command with Sylva-specific configurations if any.

2. **Set Up `kubectl` for Local Management**: After initializing the control plane, set up the kubeconfig file for `kubectl` to communicate with the cluster.

    ```shell
    mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
    sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
    ```

3. **Join Worker Nodes**: Use the `kubeadm join` command provided at the end of the `kubeadm init` output to join each worker node to the cluster.

    ```shell
    kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
    ```

    TODO: Include a note on how to retrieve the join command if it is lost or expires.

4. **Install a Pod Network**: Choose and install a pod network add-on so that your pods can communicate with each other.

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f <add-on.yaml>
    ```

    TODO: Recommend a pod network add-on that is compatible with Sylva and provide the installation command.

## Post-Installation Verification

After the installation is complete, perform the following steps to verify that the Kubernetes cluster is functioning correctly:

1. **Check Cluster Nodes**: Ensure that all the nodes are up and have joined the cluster.

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

2. **Validate Cluster Health**: Run health checks to confirm that the cluster is operational.

    ```shell
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

    TODO: Provide additional Sylva-specific health checks if necessary.

## Sylva Integration

TODO: Explain how the newly created Kubernetes cluster integrates with the Sylva ecosystem, including any additional steps or configurations required.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the installation, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check the system logs for each node for any errors related to `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, or the container runtime.
- Ensure that all nodes meet the minimum system requirements.
- Verify that the container runtime and network plugin are functioning correctly.

TODO: Include a list of common issues and solutions specific to Sylva and `kubeadm`.

## FAQ

TODO: Compile a list of frequently asked questions related to the installation process using `kubeadm` within the Sylva framework.

This document provides a general outline for installing a Kubernetes cluster using the `kubeadm` tool. The TODO sections should be completed with Sylva-specific details to ensure a comprehensive guide for users.
