## Introduction

Sylva is an ambitious open-source initiative aimed at creating a cloud software framework specifically for Telco and Edge use cases. It is driven by the collaboration of leading European telecommunications operators and network function providers.

_TODO: Add more background information about the inception of the Sylva project._

## Objectives

The Sylva project is focused on two main objectives:

1. **Developing a Cloud Software Framework**: This framework is intended to be "production grade" and will serve as a foundation for third parties to create commercial products.

2. **Reference Implementation and Validation**: Establishing a program to validate commercial network functions and implementations based on the Sylva framework.

_TODO: Elaborate on the strategic goals and how they align with the broader vision of the European digital market._

## Characteristics

- **European Telecom Ecosystem Centric**: Tailored to meet the specific needs of the European telecom market.
- **Open Collaboration**: Encouraging contributions from a diverse set of stakeholders.
- **Leveraging Existing Initiatives**: Building upon proven cloud-native technologies and community-driven projects.

_TODO: Describe the governance model and how decisions are made within the Sylva project._

## Non-Objectives

- **Not a Product**: Sylva is not intended to be a standalone product but a framework for developing such products.
- **Global Participation**: While focused on European needs, Sylva is open to global participation.

_TODO: Clarify what Sylva does not aim to do, to prevent any misconceptions._

## Alignment with Other Projects

Sylva is designed to complement and extend existing initiatives like Kubernetes and Anuket RA2, addressing gaps specific to European Telco use cases.

_TODO: Provide examples of how Sylva integrates with and contributes to other open-source projects._

## Technical Requirements

Sylva addresses a range of technical requirements including:

- Enhanced performance support (e.g., EPA, DPDK, SR-IOV)
- Support for specific synchronization cards for O-RAN (PTP)
- Bare Metal automation provisioning
- Multi-Clustering support

_TODO: Detail the technical requirements and how they translate into Sylva's architecture._

## Release Timeline

The project's initial contributions are expected in 2023, with a major release (V1) planned for mid-2023.

_TODO: Outline the roadmap with key milestones and expected features for each release._

## How to Contribute

Contributions to Sylva can be made in various forms, including code, documentation, and participating in community discussions.

_TODO: Provide detailed instructions on how to get involved and contribute to the Sylva project._

## Community and Communication

Engagement with the Sylva community is facilitated through various channels such as Slack, mailing lists, and regular meetings.

_TODO: List the communication platforms used by the Sylva project and how to access them._

## FAQ

Answers to frequently asked questions about the Sylva project can be found here.

_TODO: Compile a list of FAQs based on common queries from the community._

## Glossary

A glossary of terms related to the Sylva project and the broader telecom ecosystem.

_TODO: Include a comprehensive glossary to help new contributors understand the terminology used in the project._
