# Glossary

Here is a glossary of key terms related to the Sylva project and the broader telecom ecosystem:

    5G: The fifth generation of mobile network technology, offering faster speeds and more reliable connections on mobile devices.

    Anuket: A project within the Linux Foundation that provides a common model for virtualized and cloud-native network functions.

    Bare Metal: Physical servers without hypervisors, offering direct access to hardware resources.

    CaaS (Container as a Service): A cloud service model that allows users to manage and deploy containers with less overhead.

    Cloud Native: A set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

    CNF (Cloud Native Network Function): A network function designed to run in a cloud-native environment, leveraging containerization and microservices architecture.

    Containerization: The use of Linux containers to deploy applications in a fast, efficient, and portable manner.

    DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit): A set of libraries and drivers for fast packet processing in software-defined networking (SDN) applications.

    Edge Computing: A distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.

    EUCS (European Union Cloud Strategy): The European Union's framework for promoting cloud adoption and ensuring data security and sovereignty within the EU.

    Kubernetes: An open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

    O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network): An industry consortium fostering a more open and intelligent RAN architecture.

    OpenStack: An open-source cloud computing platform for building and managing public and private clouds.

    PTP (Precision Time Protocol): A protocol used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network.

    RA2 (Reference Architecture 2): An Anuket project reference model for cloud-native telecom infrastructure.

    RAN (Radio Access Network): Part of a mobile telecommunication system that connects individual devices to other parts of a network through radio connections.

    SDN (Software Defined Networking): An approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to direct traffic on the network and communicate with the underlying hardware infrastructure.

    SR-IOV (Single Root Input/Output Virtualization): A technology that allows a single physical network device to appear as multiple separate, virtualized devices.

    Telco: Short for telecommunications company, a provider of telecommunications services.

    VMWare: A subsidiary of Dell Technologies that provides cloud computing and platform virtualization software and services.

    Workload Cluster: In the context of Kubernetes, a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

This glossary provides a foundational understanding of the terms frequently used within the Sylva project documentation and discussions.
