# Security policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take Sylva's security very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Sylva, **please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitLab issues.** Instead, please responsibly disclose by submitting a **confidential issue** with a short description of the security breach (please do not include detailed information in the issue) and your email.

The security team will contact you by email within 48 hours to get more details to help us better understand the nature of the issue. At least, you should provide the following information:

- The location of the affected source code
- The configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

After the initial reply to your report, the security team  will send a more detailed response within 96 hours and, then, keep you informed of the progress during which we may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Supported Versions

We only apply security patches on the latest tagged release and on the `main` branch. Do not expect us to fix security issues on past releases. We are only maintaining one release.
